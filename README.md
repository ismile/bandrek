This project is my hands-on exploration of Jetpack Compose through the creation of a customizable Android launcher and/or Frontend Emulator. As I dive into modern UI development, I'm learning how to leverage the power of Compose to build an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

## Project Goals

- **Learn Jetpack Compose**: Experimenting with the latest UI toolkit for Android to enhance my development skills.
- **Build a Functional Launcher**: Creating a customizable home screen experience that allows users to manage apps and widgets.
- **Build a Functional Frontend Emulator**: Extending the launcher to function as a frontend Emulator, bridging the gap between a launcher and a gaming-focused interface.
- **Implement Modern Design Principles**: Focusing on responsive design and smooth animations.
